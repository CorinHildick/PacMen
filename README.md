# PacMen
A learning project done though emeritus. This project uses html and javascript to create pacman elements, give them a random position and velocity, and bounce them within the bounds of the web page.

## How to Run
The "Add PacMan" button creates a Pacman element in a random location on the page. The "Start Game" button begins the animation, in which they move in an initially random direction and speed and bounce off the sizes of the web page.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
1. Animate PacMen opening and closing mouth
2. Animate PacMen changing direction
3. Add a "Stop Game" button to pause the animation
4. Add a "Clear PacMen" button to remove all PacMen
